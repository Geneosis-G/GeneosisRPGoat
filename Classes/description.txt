[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This mod have been requested since the MMO map update came out ^^ Everyone wanted a life bar on his goat :p
I delayed this mod a lot because I couldn't find a way to display the life bar correctly on the screen... Anyway, after copy-pasting a huge part of the code of the MMO update I finally made it work :D
After that, I had to make it possible for the goat to be damaged. Hopefully some event in the game (explosions and the player attacks) already use the correct functions to make damages so I only had to scale the damage value correctly for them. Anyway most of the things that would obviously hurt you (fire, enemy attacks) had no effect at all so I had to make my own code to make them affect the goat. For the fire I added a 1 damage per second effect, for vehicles hurting you I added some damages depending on se speed of the vehicle, and for the rest I created the acceleration damages.
The main reason behind this last solution is that there was no way to detect enemy attacks as they are not triggering any function I can see from a mutator class... So detecting the acceleration when you get hurt by an attack sounded like a good idea :) I had to configure it precisely to avoid that you take damages from a simple jump, but after doing it the result was really cool because a side effect of this damage detection was to automatically add fall damages and speed collision damages.
